## Auditory

### Media

intro:    
turn volume off and show show a video and/or play an mp3    
  - find example video to play
  - fine example audio to play

Explain:    
Captioning / Transcripts are important

Most major streaming services provide a way to add captioning.  Only Youtube offers auto-captioning via speech recognition, but it's not always perfect.

Video Host | Captioning Available | Auto-captioning
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Brightcove | [yes](https://docs.brightcove.com/en/player/brightcove-player/guides/adding-captions-to-videos.html) | no
Ooyala | [yes](http://help.ooyala.com/video-platform/concepts/chapter_closed_captions.html) | no
Vimeo | [yes](https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/224968828-Captions-and-subtitles) | no, but you can hire a third party service through the site
Youtube | [yes](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en) | [YES](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en)
 
Solution:

Always include a caption file or transcript.  




## Cognitive

Distractions

### animations

* find example of a subtle, always-running, animation (carousels!!!)
* find examples of mouseever effects and sudden autoplay video/audio

### busy / crowded pages

* find example of busy pages

Solution:

:no_entry_sign: stop doing it :no_entry_sign:




## Motor

- a slider where you need to drag something to change content
- mouseover reveals
- small touch targets
- and too large of targets (accidental touches firing it)



## Visual

### Color contrast

Forms with disabled buttons

https://axesslab.com/disabled-buttons-suck/

- They are hard to see

- They fool users into clicking
- They donâ€™t give any feedback
- rely too much on as-you-type error handling
- they make users think.  [don't make users think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)
