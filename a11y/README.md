This talked is targeted to designers.  A more dev focused one is coming later

My talk outline.  It'll all be in the slides, this is just meant for myself


## Intro

**Slide 1:**

- what is a11y
- what I'm going to be going over
    - Auditory
    - Cognitive
    - Motor
    - Visual



## Auditory

**Slide 1: intro**

[Play a video with the volume down]

speaker notes:    
Can anyone tell me what they are saying in this video?    
This is how a person with hearing disabilities experiences videos.  


**Slide 2: stats**

* About 2 to 3 out of every 1,000 children
* Approximately 15% of American adults over 18
* Age is strongest predictor

source: https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing

speaker notes:    
* About 2 to 3 out of every 1,000 children in the United States are born with a detectable level of hearing loss in one or both ears.
* Approximately 15% of American adults (37.5 million) aged 18 and over report some trouble hearing
* Age is the strongest predictor of hearing loss among adults aged 20-69, with the greatest amount of hearing loss in the 60 to 69 age group.


**Slide 3: solution**

Always include a closed captions file or transcripts.


Slide 4: video hosting services

Video Host | Captioning Available | Auto-captioning
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Brightcove | [yes](https://docs.brightcove.com/en/player/brightcove-player/guides/adding-captions-to-videos.html) | no
Ooyala | [yes](http://help.ooyala.com/video-platform/concepts/chapter_closed_captions.html) | no
Vimeo | [yes](https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/224968828-Captions-and-subtitles) | no, but you can hire a third party service through the site
Youtube | [yes](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en) | [YES](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en)

speaker notes:    
Most major streaming services provide a way to add captioning.  Only Youtube offers auto-captioning via speech recognition, but it's not always perfect.

Big offender:  carousels!

* find example of a subtle, always-running, animations (carousels!!!)
* find examples of mouseever effects and sudden autoplay video/audio

speaker notes:

slide 3: Solution

:no_entry_sign: stop doing it :no_entry_sign:

but for real:  
ongoing/endless repeating animations can be distracting.  That includes gifs.

speaker notes:    
There's not much I can say but to minimize animations.  Do not use ongoing animations



## Motor

* Motor
    * some breaks an arm
    * decreased ability to make precise motions
    * trembling


- a slider where you need to drag something to change content
- mouseover reveals
- small touch targets
- and too large of targets (accidental touches firing it)



## Visual

Visual    
about 7.5 mil  (2.34% of the population) with some kind of visual empairment in the U.S.
source: https://nfb.org/blindness-statistics    
I added up all the totals in the State distribution chart and compared it to the total US population (323.1 mil)

* Visually impaired
    * blind / partially blind
    * color blind
    * visual deterioration due to age

### Color contrast

Forms with disabled buttons

https://axesslab.com/disabled-buttons-suck/

- They are hard to see

- They fool users into clicking
- They donâ€™t give any feedback
- rely too much on as-you-type error handling
- they make users think.  [don't make users think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)
